Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, composition, structure, and the changes it undergoes. It explores the interactions between different substances and the energy transformations associated with chemical reactions. Chemistry is essential for understanding the world around us, from the composition of the air we breathe to the materials that make up our bodies and the products we use every day.
